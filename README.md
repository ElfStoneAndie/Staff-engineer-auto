## Repository Overview
**Staff Engineer Auto** is a productivity and automation tool aiming to simplify complex software engineering workflows. It leverages modular design, advanced navigation loops, and AI-driven automation features to meet the demands of modern-day professional engineering and compliance requirements (e.g., Apple CarPlay).

## Vision & Purpose
The project focuses on three key milestones as described in `MASTER_STATE.md`:
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Develop a core navigation engine with TTS-based voice-guided navigation that strictly complies with Apple's MapKit and CarPlay guidelines.
2. **Phase 2 (Premium Expansion):** Introduce advanced modular features like AI hazard detection and premium TTS voice packages.
3. **Phase 3 (Future):** Incorporate multi-agent orchestration logic and synchronous multi-platform functionality.

## Key Features
- Core navigation logic and robust safety-first automation.
- Modular design for better scalability.
- Automation-first CI/CD workflows to streamline testing/deployment cycles.

## Roadmap Summary
